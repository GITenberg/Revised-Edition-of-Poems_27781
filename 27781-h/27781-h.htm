5</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The Author respectfully submits to the general public of his
native town and district, this volume of poems, containing some
of the chief results of his musings for the past thirty
years.&nbsp; He hopes that the volume, which is in reality the
production of a life-time, will in many ways be deemed worthy of
the kind and courteous approbation of his numerous patrons and
friends, as well as the indulgence of literary critics.</p>
<p>In launching forth the work, the Author begs to tender to his
patrons and the public generally, his most sincere and hearty
thanks for the assistance they have ever rendered him so as to
enable him to acquire the necessary leisure for the cultivation
of his muse.&nbsp; The result now achieved <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>is not the
comprehensive collection of the efforts of the author, but it may
he taken as a selection and a representation of his more
generally interesting productions from time to time.</p>
<p>Various reasons have operated in the time of the publication
and the curtailment of this volume; but it is now submitted with
every respect to the public for their perusal.&nbsp; Many of his
poems, which are not found in the present volume, the author
trusts will be deemed worthy of being treasured in the scrap
books of his friends.&nbsp; Of the literary merits of the
composition, it would ill become the author in any way to descant
upon; but in regard to these he leaves himself entirely and
absolutely in the hands of a critical, and, he hopes, an
indulgent public, feeling assured that he may trust himself in
the hands of his readers.</p>
<p>No formal dedication is here made to any particular patron,
but the book is submitted without the powerful influence of any
conspicuous name or the commendation of any well-known literary
friend; and like Dr. Johnson of old, failing patrons, he trusts
that his work will, in the midst of his numerous competitors,
locally and generally, be thought worthy of the attention of the
various classes of the public.</p>

9</span>The Grand Old Man of Oakworth.</h3>
<p>Come, hand me down that rustic harp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From off that rugged wall,<br />
For I must sing another song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To suit the Muse&rsquo;s call,<br />
For she is bent to sing a p&oelig;an,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On this eventful year,<br />
In praise of the philanthropist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom all his friends hold dear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Man of Oakworth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond his eightieth year!</p>
<p>No flattery!&nbsp; My honest Muse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet be thou servile;<br />
But tinkle up that harp again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment to beguile.<br />
Altho&rsquo; the bard be rude and rough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, he is ever proud<br />
To do the mite that he can do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus proclaim aloud&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Man of Oakworth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of whom we all are proud!</p>
<p>For base indeed were any bard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever sang on earth,<br />
Did he not wish his neighbour well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And praise his sterling worth.<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Leave state affairs and office<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To those of younger blood,<br />
But I am with the patriot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble, wise, and good&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Man of Oakworth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wise, the great, the good!</p>
<p>This worthy old philanthropist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom all his neighbours greet;<br />
Who has a smile for every one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom he may chance to meet&mdash;<br />
Go to yon pleasant village,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the margin of the moor,<br />
And you will hear his praises sung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all the aged poor&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Man of Oakworth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend unto the poor!</p>
<p>Long may he live! and happy be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The patriot and the sire;<br />
And may some other harp give praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose notes will sound much higher.<br />
His thirst for knowledge, worth, and lore&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart was ever there&mdash;<br />
This worthy old philanthropist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond his eightieth year!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Man of Oakworth,<br

11</span>THOUGHTS SUGGESTED<br />
<span class="smcap">on hearing</span><br />
Dr. Dobie&rsquo;s Lecture on Burns.</h3>
<p>Though murky are the days and short,<br />
And man he finds but little sport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These gloomy days, to cheer him;<br />
Yet, if a Dobie should, perchance,<br />
Come out before an audience,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis worth our while to hear him.</p>
<p>Right pleased was I, dear sir, to hear<br />
Your lecture on that subject dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So grand and superhuman;<br />
For all the world doth pay regard<br />
To Bobbie Burns, the Scottish bard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The patriot and the ploughman.</p>
<p>Your words, indeed, were passing good,<br />
On him who kenned and understood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kirk and all its ranting;<br />
Who &ldquo;held the mirror&rdquo; up, indeed,<br />
To show the &ldquo;muckle unco-guid&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their double-dy&eacute;d canting.</p>
<p>You painted him sometimes in glee<br />
While other times in poverty&mdash;<br />

Yet, after all he kept his pace,<br />
And looked grim fortune in the face,<br />

12</span>But, alas! the picture, was it true?<br />
Of Burns&rsquo; parents, poor and low&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So furrowed and so hoary&mdash;<br />
It makes our very hearts to burn<br />
To think that &ldquo;man was made to mourn,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tell the sad, sad story.</p>
<p>You brought me back to days bygone,<br />
When glad its banks I strolled upon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The river Doon so bonnie;<br />
The roofless kirk and yard so green,<br />
Where many a tombstone may be seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Tam and Souter Johnnie.</p>
<p>And when ye spake of yond bright star<br />
That lingers in the lift afar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Burns was never weary<br />
Of gazing on the far-off sphere,<br />
Where dwells his angel lassie dear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His ain sweet Highland Mary!</p>
<p>But here my Muse its wings may lower;<br />
Such flights are far beyond its power;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So I will stop the jingle.<br />
Sir, I am much obliged to you,<br />
And I am much indebted to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Choir and Mr. Pringle.</p>

14</span>The Death of Gordon.</h3>
<p>From the red fields of gore, &rsquo;midst war&rsquo;s dreadful
clang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear a sad strain o&rsquo;er oceans afar:<br />
Oh, shame, shame upon you, ye proud men of England,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose highest ambition is rapine and war!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through your
vain wickedness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands are
fatherless,<br />
False your pretensions old Egypt to save;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arabs with spear
in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far in a distant
land<br />
Made our brave Gordon a sad and red grave.</p>
<p>On Nile&rsquo;s sunny banks, with the Arab&rsquo;s great
nation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave Gordon was honoured and worshipped by all,<br
/>
The acknowledged master of the great situation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until England&rsquo;s bondholders caused Egypt to
fall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another great
blunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes the world
wonder,<br />
Where is Britannia&rsquo;s sword, sceptre and shield?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War and
disaster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come thicker and
faster,<br />
Oh, for the days of the Great Beaconsfield!</p>
<p>Oh, Great Beaconsfield! the wise and the clever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When will thy place in our nation be filled?<br />
Britannia&rsquo;s shrill answer is never, oh never,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Beaconsfield&rsquo;s dead, and my Gordon is
killed!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page

Roman,<br />
Or Soudanese Arabs for Gordon&rsquo;s sad doom;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But blame that

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose name is

<h3>The Earl of Beaconsfield.</h3>
<p>I sing no song of superstition,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No dark deeds of an Inquisition,<br />
No mad-brain&rsquo;d theme of wild ambition,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For lo, their doom is sealed!<br />
But I will use my best endeavour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To praise the good, the wise, the clever,<br />
Who will remember&rsquo;d be for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earl of Beaconsfield.</p>
<p>When England was without alliance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He bid the Russians bold defiance,<br />
On Austria had no reliance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In either flood or field;<br />
He proudly sent to Hornby message,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dardanelles! go force the passage<br />
In spite of Turkey, Bear, or Sausage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dauntless Beaconsfield!</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>At Berlin, he with admiration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was gazed upon by every nation,<br />
And, master of the situation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vow&rsquo;d Britons ne&rsquo;er would yield.<br />
For I am here, you may depend on&rsquo;t,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This Eastern brawl to make an end on&rsquo;t,<br />
To show both plaintiff and defendant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Earl of Beaconsfield!</p>
<p>Britannia now doth weep and ponder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bereaved of him, her child of wonder,<br />
No earthly power could break asunder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His love for England&rsquo;s weal.<br />
And now those locks once dark as raven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (For laurel leaves ne&rsquo;er deck&rsquo;d a
craven)<br />
Wear a laurel crown in Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glorious Beaconsfield!</p>

<h3>The Lass o&rsquo; Newsholme Dean.</h3>
<p>[Having spent the whole of the afternoon in this romantic
little glen, indulging in pleasant meditations, I began to wend
my way down the craggy pass that leads to the bonny little hamlet
of Goose Eye, and turning round to take a last glance at this
enchanting vale&mdash;with its running whimpering stream&mdash;I
beheld the &ldquo;Lass o&rsquo; Newsholme Dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was engaged in driving home a Cochin China hen and her
chickens.&nbsp; Instantaneously I was seized with a poetic fit,
and gazing upon her as did Robert Tannyhill upon his imaginary
beauty, &ldquo;The Flower of Dumblane,&rdquo; I struck my lyre,
and, although the theme of my song turned out afterwards to be a
respectable old woman of 70 winters, yet there is still a charm
in my &ldquo;Lass o&rsquo; Newsholme Dean.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Thy kiss is sweet, thy words are kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy love is all to me;<br />

28</span>The Broken Pitcher.</h3>
<p>[The happiest moments of a soldier in times of peace are when
sat round the hearth of his neat little barrack room, along with
his comrades, spinning yarns and telling tales; sometimes giving
the history of some famous battle or engagement in which he took
a prominent part; other times he will relate his own love
adventures; then the favourite of the room will oblige them with
his song of &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Napoleon&rdquo;
(generally being the favourites with them);&mdash;then there is
the fancy tale teller, who amuses all.&nbsp; But in all cases the
teller of a tale, yarn, or story, makes himself the hero of it,
and especially when he speaks of the lass he left behind him;
hence this adventure with the &ldquo;Lassie by the
Well.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>There was a bonny Lassie once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting by a well&mdash;<br />
But what this bonny Lassie thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot, cannot tell&mdash;<br />
When by there went a cavalier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well known as Willie Wright,<br />
Just in full marching order,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His armour shining bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah maiden, lovely maiden, why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sits thou by the spring?<br />
Dost thou seek a lover, with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden wedding ring?<br />
Or wherefore dost thou gaze on me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With eyes so bright and wide?<br />
Or wherefore does that pitcher lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broken by thy side?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;My pitcher it is broken, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this the reason is,<br />
A villian came behind me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; he tried to steal a kiss.<br />
I could na take his nonsense,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So ne&rsquo;er a word I spoke,<br />
But hit him with my pitcher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus you see &rsquo;tis broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle Jock McNeil, ye ken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now waits for me to come;<br />
He canna mak his Crowdy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till t&rsquo;watter it goes home.<br />
I canna tak him watter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that I ken full weel,<br />
And so I&rsquo;m sure to catch it,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he&rsquo;ll play the varry
de&rsquo;il.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah maiden, lovely maiden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray be ruled by me;<br />
Smile with thine eyes and ruby lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give me kisses three.<br />
And we&rsquo;ll suppose my helmet is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pitcher made o&rsquo; steel,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll carry home some watter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thy uncle Jock McNeil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She silently consented, for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She blink&rsquo;d her bonny ee,<br />
I threw mi arms around her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave her kisses three.<br />
To wrong the bonny Lassie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sware &rsquo;twould be a sin;<br />
So knelt dahn by the watter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dip mi helmet in.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Out spake this bonny Lassie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My soldier lad, forbear,<br />
I wadna spoil thi bonny plume<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That decks thi raven hair;<br />
Come buckle up thy sword again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on thi cap o&rsquo; steel,<br />
I carena for my pitcher, nor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My uncle Jock McNeil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I often think, my comrades,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About this Northern queen,<br />
And fancy that I see her smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though mountains lay between.<br />
But should you meet her Uncle Jock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll never tell<br />
How I squared the broken pitcher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Lassie at the well.</p>
<h3>Ode to Sir Titus Salt.</h3>
<p>Go, string once more old Ebor&rsquo;s harp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring it here to me,<br />
For I must sing another song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme of which shall be,&mdash;<br />
A worthy old philanthropist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose soul in goodness soars,<br />
And one whose name will stand as firm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As rocks that gird our shores;<br />
The fine old Bradford gentleman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good Sir Titus Salt.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Heedless of others; some there are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who all their days employ<br />
To raise themselves, no matter how,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And better men destroy:<br />
How different is the mind of him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose deeds themselves are told,<br />
Who values worth more nobly far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than all the heaps of gold.</p>
<p>His feast and revels are not such,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As those we hear and see,<br />
No princely show does he indulge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor feats of revelry;<br />
But in the orphan schools they are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or in the cot with her,<br />
The widow and the orphan of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shipwrecked mariner,</p>
<p>When stricken down with age and care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His good old neighbours grieved,<br />
Or loss of family or mate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or all on earth bereaved;<br />
Go see them in their houses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where peace their days may end,<br />
And learn from them the name of him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is their aged friend.</p>
<p>With good and great his worth shall live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With high or lowly born;<br />
His name is on the scroll of fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet as the songs of morn;<br />
While tyranny and villany<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is surely stamped with shame;<br />
A nation gives her patriot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A never-dying fame.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>No empty titles ever could<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His principles subdue,<br />
His queen and country too he loved,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was loyal and was true:<br />
He craved no boon from royalty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor wished their pomp to share,<br />
Far nobler is the soul of him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The founder of Saltaire.</p>
<p>Thus lives this sage philanthropist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From courtly pomp removed,<br />
But not secluded from his friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For frienship&rsquo;s bond he loved;<br />
A noble reputation too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowns all his latter days;<br />
The young men they admire him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the aged they him praise.</p>
<p>Long life to thee, Sir Titus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The darling of our town;<br />
Around thy head while living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll weave a laurel crown.<br />
Thy monument in marble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May suit the passer by,<br />
But a monument in all our hearts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will never, never die.</p>
<p>And when thy days are over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we miss thee on our isle,<br />
Around thy tomb for ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May unfading laurels smile:<br />
Then may the sweetest flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Usher in the spring;<br />
And roses in the gentle gales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their balmy odours fling.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>May summer&rsquo;s beams shine sweetly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon thy hallowed clay,<br />
And yellow autumn o&rsquo;er thy head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yield many a placid ray;<br />
May winter winds blow slightly,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The green-grass softly wave,<br />
And falling snow drop lightly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon thy honoured grave.</p>

37</span>Some of My Boyish Days.</h3>
<p>Home of my boyish days, how can I call<br />
Scenes to my memory, that did befall?<br />
How can my trembling pen find power to tell<br />
The grief I experienced in bidding farewell?<br />
Can I forget the days joyously spent,<br />
That flew on so rapidly, sweet with content?<br />
Can I then quit thee, whose memory&rsquo;s so dear,<br />
Home of my boyish days, without one tear?</p>
<p>Can I look back on happy days gone by,<br />
Without one pleasant thought, without one sigh<br />
Ah, no! though never more these eyes may dwell<br />
On thee, old cottage home, I love so well:<br />
Home of my childhood! wherever I be,<br />
Thou art the nearest and dearest to me!<br />
<br />
Can I forget the songs sung by my sire,<br />
Like some prophetic bard tuning the lyre?<br />
Sweet were the notes that he taught to the young;<br />
Psalms for the Sabbath, on Sabbath were sung;<br />
And the young minstrels enraptured would come<br />
To the little lone cottage I once called my home.</p>
<p>Can I forget the dear landscape around,<br />
Where in my boyish days I could be found,<br />
Stringing my hazel-bow, roaming the wood,<br />
Fancying myself to be bold Robin Hood?<br />
Then would my mother say&mdash;&ldquo;Where is he gone?<br />
I&rsquo;m waiting for shuttles that he should have
&lsquo;wun&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
She in that cottage there, knitting her healds,<br />
And I, her young forester, roaming the fields.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>But the shades of the evening gather slowly around,<br
/>
The twilight it thickens and darkens the ground,<br />
Night&rsquo;s sombre mantle is spreading the plain.<br />
And as I turn round to look on thee again,<br />
To take one fond look, one last fond adieu,<br />
By night&rsquo;s envious hand thou art snatched from my view;<br
/>
But Oh! there&rsquo;s no darkness&mdash;to me&mdash;no decay,<br
/>
Home of my boyhood, can chase thee away!</p>

<h3>In a Pleasant Little Valley.</h3>
<p>In a pleasant little valley near the ancient town of Ayr,<br

Where the laddies they are honest, and the lassies they are
fair;<br />
Where Doon in all her splendour ripples sweetly through the
wood,<br />
And on its banks not long ago a little cottage stood;<br />
&rsquo;Twas there, in all her splendour, on a January morn,<br />
Appeared old Coila&rsquo;s genius&mdash;when Robert Burns was
born.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Her mantle large of greenish hue and robe of tartan
shone,<br />
And round its mystic border seen was Luger, Ayr, and Doon;<br />
A leaf-clad holly bough was twined so graceful round her brow,<br
/>
She was the darling native muse of Scotia then, as now:<br />
So grand old Coila&rsquo;s genius on this January morn,<br />
Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.</p>
<p>She vowed she ne&rsquo;er would leave him till he sung old
Scotia&rsquo;s plains&mdash;<br />
The daisy, and the milk-white thorn he tuned in lovely
strains;<br />
And sung of yellow autumn, or some lovely banks and braes:<br />
And make each cottage home resound with his sweet tuneful
lays,<br />
And sing how Coila&rsquo;s genius, on a January morn,<br />
Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.</p>
<p>She could not teach him painting like her Cunningham at
home,<br />
Nor could she teach him sculpturing like Angelo of Rome;<br />
But she taught him how to wander her lovely hills among,<br />
And sing her bonny burns and glens in simple rustic song;<br />
This old Coila&rsquo;s genius did that January morn,<br />
Vow in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>And in the nights of winter, when stormy winds do
roar,<br />
And the fierce dashing waves are heard on Ayr&rsquo;s old craggy

Fer ivvery druggist window sed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Real poison is sold here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last I gav a frantic howl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shaat o&rsquo; dreead despair,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; shack&rsquo;d an&rsquo; lugged mi

&nbsp;&nbsp; It wor another goast!</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; When turning t&rsquo;Sharman&rsquo;s Nuke.</p>
<p>Abaat two hunderd yards i&rsquo; t&rsquo;front,<br />

<p>Whativver can these noises be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some robbers, then I thowt!&mdash;<br />

<p>This made owd Nick fair raging mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; liftin&rsquo; up his whip,<br />
He gav owd Spinnel Shanks a lash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across his upper lip.</p>
<p>Then like a neighin&rsquo; steed, lean Shanks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give owd Nick leg bail,<br />
He started off towards the tahn,<br />

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was a man, take him for all-in-all, we

</blockquote>
<p>Who knew his virtues must his death deplore<br />
And long lament that Ireland is no more;<br />
Set is the sun that shone with all its rays,<br />
And claimed from every one their warmest praise.</p>
<p>Mute are those lips, whose mildest accents spoke<br />
Their sterling worth, down to the harmless joke;<br />
Clear-seeing his soul, for lo! that mind was one<br />
That envied nothing underneath the sun.</p>
<p>To speak the truth, he never was afraid;<br />
His country&rsquo;s weal, his country&rsquo;s laws obeyed;<br />
A pensive calm reigned on his noble brow,<br />
While in his eye you read the solemn vow:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I harm no one; no one will I betray;<br />
My duty is to watch and see fair play;<br />
My friendship is to no one set confined;<br />
My heart and hand are given to all mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh ancient town of legendary strain<br />
When will his place in thee be filled again!<br />
For men like he, possessed of sterling worth,<br />
Are few and far between upon the earth.</p>
<p>Such was the man the weeping mourners mourn,<br />
Lost to his friends, ah! never to return;<br />
Fled to the spheres where he in peace must dwell,<br />
While all who knew him bid a long farewell.</p>

<h3>Lines on the Late<br />
MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.</h3>
<p>Darkness his curtain, and his bed the dust&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend we had but yesterday;<br />
His spirit to the unknown land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath fled
away.</p>
<p>Ah! death&rsquo;s strong key hath turned the lock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And closed again its ponderous door,<br />
That ne&rsquo;er for him shall ope again&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah,
nevermore!</p>
<p>Now pity swells the tide of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rolls through all our bosoms deep,<br />
For we have lost a friend indeed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus we
weep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . . . .</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas his to learn in Nature&rsquo;s school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To love his fellow-creatures dear;<br />
His bounty fed the starving poor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From year to
year.</p>
<p>But thou, pale moon, unclouded beam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And O! ye stars, shine doubly bright,<br />
And light him safe across the lake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To endless
light!</p>

60</span>The Grand Old Man.</h3>
<p>I sing of a statesman, a statesman of worth,<br />
The grandest old statesman there is upon earth;<br />
When his axe is well sharpened we all must agree,<br />
He can level a nation as well as a tree.</p>
<p>He can trundle such words from his serpent-like tongue<br />
As fairly bewilder both old men and young;<br />
He can make some believe that&rsquo;s black which is white,<br />
And others believe it is morn when it&rsquo;s night.</p>
<p>He has tampered with kings, and connived with the Czar;<br />
His Bulgarian twaddle once caused a great war,<br />
Where thousands were slain, but what did he heed,<br />
He still went to Church the lessons to read.</p>
<p>A bumbailey army to Egypt he sent,<br />
In search of some money which long had been spent;<br />
He blew up the forts, then commended his men,<br />
And ordered them back to old England again.</p>
<p>In the far distant Soudan the Mahdi arose,<br />
No doubt he intended to crush all his foes;<br />
But Gladstone sent Gordon, who ne&rsquo;er was afraid,<br />
Then left him to perish without any aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I,&rdquo; said poor Gordon, &ldquo;get out of this
place,<br />
That traitor called Gladstone shall ne&rsquo;er see my
face&mdash;<br />
To the Congo I&rsquo;ll go, if I am not slain,<br />
And never put foot in old England again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>When the sad news arrived of the fall of Khartoum,<br />
And of how our brave Gordon had met his sad doom,<br />
Gladstone went to the theatre and grinned in a box,<br />
Tho&rsquo; he knew that old England was then on the rocks.</p>
<p>He allowed the Dutch Boers on Majuba Hill,<br />
Our brave little army to torture and kill;<br />
And while our poor fellows did welter in gore,<br />
He gave up the sword to the treacherous Boer.</p>
<p>Brave, though black Cetewayo, the great Zulu King,<br />
To civilised England they captive did bring;<br />
He sent back the Zulu, where first he drew breath,<br />
Unguarded and helpless, to meet his own death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I done,&rdquo; says Bismark, &ldquo;so much in my
life,<br />
As Gladstone has done in fomenting sad strife,<br />
I could not at this day have looked in the face<br />
Of king, prince or peasant of my noble race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has tampered and tarnished his national fame;<br />
He has injured Great Britain in interest and aim&mdash;<br />
Caused strife, war and bloodshed too reckless I ween,<br />
Not caring for honour of England or Queen.</p>
<p>He invokes the great gods their rich blessing to shower,<br />
As he stumps our great nation to get into power;<br />
E&rsquo;en now from old Ireland he cravenly begs,<br />
That she will assist him to get on his legs.</p>

<p>Pueple god of joyous wit,<br />

thee!<br />
Deign to let the bardie sit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near thy

Thy open brow, and laughing eye,<br />
Vanquishing the hidden sigh,<br />
Making care before thee fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling Bacchus, god of wine!</p>
<p>Thy stream intoxicates my song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am
warm;<br />
I love thee late, I love thee long;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou dost me

I ever loved thee much before,<br />
And now I love thee more and more,<br />
For thou art loved the wide world o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charming Bacchus, god of wine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angels hear that angels sing,&rdquo;<br />

While the muse is on the wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay regard;<br

See how Bacchus&rsquo; nectar flows,<br />
Healing up the heartstrings&rsquo; woes,<br />
Making friends, and <i>minus</i> foes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gracious Bacchus, god of wine!</p>

Friendship is the wine of love;<br />
Angels dwell with it above,<br />
Cooing like the turtle-dove<br />

awhile!<br />
Ere thou tak&rsquo;st thy upward flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon me
smile;<br />
Drop one feather from thy breast<br />
On the bard, that he may rest,<br />
Then he will be doubly bless&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glorious Bacchus, god of wine!</p>
<p>Kings are great, but thou art just,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Night and
day;<br />
What are kings but royal dust&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds of
prey?<br />
Though in splendour they may be&mdash;<br />
Menials bow, and bend the knee&mdash;<br />
Oh, let me dwell along with thee,<br />

65</span>Song of the Months.</h3>
<p>High o&rsquo;er the hill-tops moan the wild breezes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As from the dark branches I hear the sad strain:<br
/>
See the lean pauper by his grim hearth he freezes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While comfort and plenty in palaces reign.</p>
<p>Dark is the visage of the rugged old ocean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the caves in the billow he rides his foamed
steed:<br />
As o&rsquo;er the grim surge with his chariot in motion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spreads desolation, and laughs at the deed.</p>
<p>No more with the tempest the river is swelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No angry clouds frown, nor sky darkly lower;<br />
The bee sounds her horn, and the gay news is telling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That spring is established with sunshine and
shower.</p>
<p>In the pride of its beauty the young year is shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nature with blossom is wreathing the trees;<br
/>
The white and the green in rich clusters entwining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sprinkling their sweets on the wings of the
breeze.</p>
<p>O May, lovely goddess! what name can be grander?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What sunbeam so bright as thine own smiling eye;<br
/>
With thy mantle of green, richly spangled in splendour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At whose sight the last demon of winter doth
fly?</p>
<p>From her home in the grass see the primrose is peeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While diamond dew-drops around her are spread;<br />
She smiles thro&rsquo; her tears like an infant that&rsquo;s
sleeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to laughter is changed as her sorrows are
fled.</p>

66</span>The landscape around is now sprinkled with flowers,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountains are blue in their distant array;<br />
The wreaths of green leaves are refreshed with the showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a moth in the sunshine the lark flies away.</p>
<p>How joyous the reapers their harvest songs singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they see the maid bring the flagon and horn;<br
/>
And the goddess of plenty benedictions is flinging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over meadows and pastures and barley and corn.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis sweet on the hills with the morning sun shining,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch the rich vale as it brightens below;<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweet in the valley when day is declining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mark the fair mountains, deep tinged with its
glow.</p>
<p>Now is the time when biting old Boreas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; True to his calling, the tempests impend;<br />
His hailstones in fury are pelting before us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our fingers are smarting, and heads they are
bent.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The beasts of the forest from hunger do call;<br />
There are desolate evenings, comfortless mornings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gloomy noontides for one and for all.</p>
<p>Drear is thine aspect, tyrannical December,<br />

So noble and grand in thy beauty and splendour<br />

<p>And long may&rsquo;st thou flourish and bloom like the

And stand like an oak in both fair and foul weather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till old Father Time hath forgotten thy date.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a pleasure to view thee from hill-top or level,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; From moorland, from meadow, or mountain afar,<br />
Where Roman pack-horsemen more safely could travel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In days when the Briton and Boman waged war.</p>
<p>In those days of yore, from Hawkcliffe to Rivoc,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wolf and the wild boar sought after their
prey,<br />
But Briton&rsquo;s brave sons amongst them made havoc,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus for Cliffe Castle they opened the way.</p>
<p>Where erst were wild woods, crags, moorlands, and marshes,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; In days long gone by and whose dates are unknown,<br

Is now the highway where stand thy proud arches,<br />

blest.</p>
<p>Like heroes of old, on horse or on vessel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On land or on water they fought and they won,<br />
And now thy grand towers, O bonnie Cliffe Castle!<br />

When His Grace the Duke of Devonshire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made our famous town a present<br />
Of a pretty little garden&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An Arcadia in its way&mdash;<br />
And how the bells rang merrily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On that eventful day.</p>

It will delight the great elite&mdash;<br />

And who are they who dare to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The town it did not need one&mdash;<br />
A pretty little lovely spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a happy little Eden.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beauty and of splendour&mdash;<br />
Search our land from end to end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You could not find a grander;<br />
The turtledove can make its love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not caring for the pigeon,<br />
If he belongs his politics<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And follows his religion.</p>
<p>In this pretty little garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bloom is on the heather,<br />
Two minds with but one single thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can tell their tales together;<br />
The maiden from the mansion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lady from the villa,<br />
Can wander there and shed a tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the weeping willow.</p>
<p>This bonny little garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is fine for perambulators,<br />
Where our handsome servant-lasses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can wheel our lovely creatures,<br />
And oh! how happy they will be!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As time they are beguiling,<br />
When the mammy and the daddy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are upon the babies smiling.</p>
<p>Oh! this pretty little garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which every one admires,<br />
Which pleased His Grace the Noble Duke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give our little squires.<br />
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the shooting of a rocket,<br />
When they heard that they had got a Park,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And were &ldquo;nothing out
o&rsquo;pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this pretty little garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all its blossom blooming<br />
We can sit and sing the whole day long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the morning till the gloaming;<br />
And tell Dame Keighley&rsquo;s blunders,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When her sons were naught but asses;<br />
And could not even raise a Park,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To please the upper classes.</p>
<p>Then let us give the Noble Duke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The praises of the Borough&mdash;<br />
For if we did not thank His Grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We should commit an error&mdash;<br />
And not forgetting Mr. Leach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he deserves rewarding,<br />
For it is known he got the town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This pretty little garden.</p>

Where many a joy we hope thou&rsquo;st had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though witness&rsquo;d many a sorry scene.</p>
<p>Thy works were good, we know it well,<br />

Beloved by all, thy foes are few,<br />

Thy duties promptly to attend,<br />

<p>And when thou leavest us behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our recollections will not die&mdash;<br />
Of thee whose meekness, zeal, and love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are known alike to low and high.</p>
<p>Out from thy fold, all other flocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were proud of thee&mdash;a shepherd true,<br />
All other shepherds greeted thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although thy flocks to theirs were few.</p>
<p>Thou tended with a shepherd&rsquo;s care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And saw that none did go astray;<br />
Thou led them with an honest will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From early morn to evening&rsquo;s ray.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear sir, long may&rsquo;st thou live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a credit to our isle;<br />

With stricken heart, and head that&rsquo;s bowed;<br />
I hear a voice, both deep and loud&mdash;<br />
A voice of one that wanted food&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thy brother.</p>
<p>The meanest wretch that ever trod,<br />
The smallest insect &rsquo;neath the sod,<br />
Are creatures of an All-seeing God,<br />
Who may have smitten with his rod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy foolish brother.</p>
<p>He careth not for wealth or show,<br />
But dares thee to neglect, e&rsquo;en now,<br />
That unmanned wretch, so poor and low,<br />
Else he may deal a heavy blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en for thy brother.</p>

All nature wor wearin&rsquo; her mantle o&rsquo; green;<br />
The birds wor all singin&rsquo; i&rsquo; owd Cockle Wood,<br />
As if by their notes they all understood,<br />
As weel as the people who com wi&rsquo; a smile,<br />
To see the procession march off i&rsquo; grand style.</p>

An&rsquo; Rowland, the bell, didn&rsquo;t toll, sir, i&rsquo;

For hunderds wur ready ta start for the train.</p>

Ower maantains, dahn valleys, it&rsquo;s saanding so clear;<br />
It&rsquo;s t&rsquo;Turkey Mill Band wi ther sharps and ther

&rsquo;Tis plain whear they&rsquo;re bahn wi&rsquo; t&rsquo;long
paces they take,<br />
An&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll play wi&rsquo; some vengeance at

<p>But, harken ageean! what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; this way?<br />
More music, grand music; hey, hear how they play!<br />
It&rsquo;s t&rsquo;Fife an&rsquo; Drum Band fra Throttlepoke

Wi&rsquo; as strong a big drummer as ivver yah saw,<br />
An&rsquo; both his drum ends must be solid as stone,<br />
Fer bi t&rsquo;way &rsquo;at he thumps he macks it fair

<p>The procession moves off in a double quick pace,<br />
An&rsquo; all seem delightful&mdash;a smile on ther face,<br />

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; home to glory,&rdquo; wi&rsquo;
credit to both t&rsquo;conductors an&rsquo; thersens.&nbsp;
Hahsumivver, they wor forced to put double time in at
t&rsquo;latter end, for Puffin&rsquo; Billy started o&rsquo;
screaming ageean fearfully, so all wor in t&rsquo;carriages
an&rsquo; off in a crack&mdash;my word, they did leg it ower

But yu mun knaw at after a deal o&rsquo; twistin&rsquo; an&rsquo;

worrant generally thowt so, for owd Nathan o&rsquo;
Johnny&rsquo;s an&rsquo; their Samuel, an&rsquo; owd Matty
o&rsquo; Sykes&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; Bob o&rsquo; t&rsquo;Bog, stood
it boldly &rsquo;at it wor goin&rsquo; back to Keighley,

ivverybody thowt at t&rsquo;train wor lost, but after another
start we landed at Windermere, an&rsquo; nearly all

<p>But, hod yer din, says Railway Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is varry clear,<br />
At t&rsquo;injun&rsquo;s reight an&rsquo; landed streight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For this is Windermere.</p>
<p>So, i&rsquo; landing, ivverbody seemed quite startled

<p>Miss Walsh an&rsquo; Miss Roddy an&rsquo; another young

To tak a fine boat an&rsquo; just hev a float<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dahn the lake as far as Dove&rsquo;s Nest.</p>

An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go ta Low Wood, it might do ma good,<br />

&ldquo;Tuppence a piece,&rdquo; says t&rsquo;Missis.
&ldquo;Tuppence a piece!&rdquo; exclaim&rsquo;d t&rsquo;dollop of

85</span>The Tartan Plaid.</h3>
<p>In Auld Lang Syne I&rsquo;ve heard &rsquo;em say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My granny then she wore<br />
A bonnie Scottish Tartan Plaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In them good days o&rsquo; yore;<br />
An&rsquo; weel I ken when I was young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some happy days we had,<br />
When ladies they were dress&rsquo;d so gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Scottish Tartan Plaid.</p>
<p>Me thinks I see my father now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat working at his loom&mdash;<br />
I see my mother at the wheel&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In our dear village home;<br />
The swinging-stick I hear again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its buzzin&rsquo; makes me sad,<br />
To think those happy days are gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When weaving Tartan Plaid.</p>
<p>It is not in a clannish view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For clans are naught to me,<br />
But &rsquo;tis our ancient Tartan Plaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I dearly love to see.<br />
&rsquo;Tis something grand ye will agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see a Highland lad,<br />
Donn&rsquo;d in his Celtic native garb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grand old Tartan Plaid.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Decked off with shining gold);<br />
Just see our kilted lads so brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes my heart feel glad,<br />
And &rsquo;minds me of my boyish days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When dress&rsquo;d in Tartan Plaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O wad some power&rdquo; the hint we give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Sovereign Lady Queen,<br />
To dress herself and lady maids<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bonnie tartan sheen.<br />
Then treadles, shuttles, warp, and weft&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (For trade would not be bad)&mdash;<br />
Would rattle as in days of yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When weaving Tartan Plaid.</p>
<h3>The Pauper&rsquo;s Box.</h3>
<p>Thou odious box, as I look on thee,<br />
I wonder wilt thou be unlocked for me?<br />
No, no! forbear!&mdash;yet then, yet then,<br />
&rsquo;Neath thy grim lid do lie the men&mdash;<br />
Men whom fortune&rsquo;s blasted arrows hit,<br />
And send them to the pauper&rsquo;s pit.</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>O dig a grave somewhere for me,<br />
Deep underneath some wither&rsquo;d tree;<br />
Or bury me on the wildest heath,<br />
Where Boreas blows his wildest breath,<br />
Or &rsquo;mid some wild romantic rocks:<br />
But, oh! forbear the pauper&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>Throw me into the ocean deep,<br />
Where many poor forgotten sleep;<br />
Or fling my corpse in the battle mound,<br />
With coffinless thousands &rsquo;neath the ground;<br />
I envy not the mightiest dome,<br />
But save me from a pauper&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>I care not if t&rsquo;were the wild wolf&rsquo;s glen,<br />
Or the prison yard, with wicked men:<br />
Or into some filthy dung-hole hurled&mdash;<br />
Anywhere, anywhere! out of the world!<br />
In fire or smoke on land or sea,<br />
Than thy grim lid be closed on me.</p>
<p>But let me pause, ere I say more<br />
About thee, unoffending door;<br />
When I bethink me, now I pause,<br />
It is not thee who makes the laws,<br />
But villians who, if all were just,<br />
In thy grim cell would lay their dust.</p>
<p>But yet, t&rsquo;were grand beneath yond wall,<br />
To lie with friends,&mdash;relations all;<br />
If sculptured tombstones were not there,<br />
But simple grass with daisies fair;<br />
And were it not, grim box, for thee<br />
&rsquo;Twere paradise, O cemetery.</p>

88</span>The Vale of Aire.</h3>
<p>[It was early in the morning that I took my ramble.&nbsp; I
had noticed but little until I arrived at the foot of the quaint
old hamlet of Marley.&nbsp; My spirits began to be cheered, for
lively gratitude glowed in my heart at the wild romantic scenery
before me.&nbsp; Passing the old mansion, I wended my way towards
the huge crag called the &ldquo;Altar Rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wild and
rugged as the scenery was, it furnished an agreeable
entertainment to my mind, and with pleasure I pushed my way to
the top of the gigantic rock, where I viewed the grandeur of the
vale below.&nbsp; The blossom on the branches, the crooked Aire
gliding along like sheets of polished crystal, made me
poetic.&nbsp; I thought of Nicholson, the poet of this beautiful
vale, and reclining on a green moss-covered bank, I framed these
words.]</p>
<p>Poet Nicholson, old Ebor&rsquo;s darling bard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accept from me at least one tributary line;<br />
Yet how much more should be thy just reward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than any wild unpolished song of mine.</p>
<p>No monument in marble can I raise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sculptured bust in honour of thy name;<br />
But humbly try to celebrate thy praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give applause that thou shouldst duly claim.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>All hail, the songsters that awake the morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soothe the soul with wild melodious strains;<br
/>
All hail, the rocks that Bingley hills adorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath whose shades wild Nature&rsquo;s grandeur
reigns.</p>
<p>From off yon rock that rears its head so high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And overlooks the crooked river Aire;<br />
While musing Nature&rsquo;s works full meet the eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The envied game, the lark and timid hare.</p>
<p>In Goitstock Falls, and rugged Marley&rsquo;s hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bingley&rsquo;s grand and quiet sequestered
dale,<br />
Each silvery stream, each dike or rippled rill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see thy haunt and read thy &ldquo;Poacher&rsquo;s
Tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Homer-like, thy harp was wont to tune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy native vale in glorious days of old,<br />
Whose maidens fair in virtuous beauty shone&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sages and her heroes great and bold.</p>
<p>No flattering baseness could employ thy mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The free-born muse detests that servile part:<br />
In simple lore thy self-taught lay I find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More grandeur far than all the gloss of art.</p>
<p>Though small regard be paid to worth so rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And humble worth unheeded pass along;<br />
Ages to come will sing the &ldquo;Yale of Aire,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Nicholson and his historic song.</p>

<h3>Address to the Queen,<br />
<span class="smcap">june</span> 20th, 1887.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To the Queen&rsquo;s Most
Excellent Majesty</i>.</p>
<p>Most Gracious Sovereign Lady, Victoria Alexandra Guelph, Queen
of the hearts of her people throughout all civilisation, one of
your Majesty&rsquo;s loyal and faithful subjects desires most
respectfully to approach your Majesty to congratulate you upon
the completion of the fiftieth year of your reign.&nbsp; In the
same year of your Majesty&rsquo;s coronation, in a wild part of
old Yorkshire, where it is said the wind never blew nor the cock
ever crew, was your Most Gracious Majesty&rsquo;s humble servant
born; and at the very hour that your Majest ascended the Throne,
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>a kind, good Yorkshire mother was rocking her baby in an
old oak cradle, while the father was treading the treadles and
picking the shuttle of his old hand-loom to the tune of
&ldquo;Britons never shall be slaves&rdquo;; and I am proud to
convey to your Majesty that the child in the old oak cradle was
no less a person than your Majesty&rsquo;s humble and obedient
servant, Bill o&rsquo;th&rsquo; Hoylus End, Poet and Philosopher
to the plebians of Keighley, and who now rejoices in the fiftieth
year of your Majesty&rsquo;s reign that he has been blessed with
good health during that long period, having had at no time
occasion to call in a physician.&nbsp; John Barleycorn has been
my medical adviser, and when I begin to review the fifty years of
your most illustrious reign, from my birth, I feel grateful
indeed, for great and mighty men and nations have risen and
fallen; but I am proud to think that your Most Gracious Majesty
and your humble servant have weathered the storm, and I also can
assure your Majesty that the lukewarm loyalty of the upper ten is
not a sample of people here, for during the latter half of your
Majesty&rsquo;s reign up to now prosperity has shone upon the
once crooked, old, mis-shapen town, for wealth has been
accumulated to the tune of millions, which I am sorry to inform
your Majesty is in the hands of those who mean to keep it.&nbsp;
One portion of your Majesty&rsquo;s lukewarm loyal subjects have
the advancement of art and science so much on the brain that it
is feared they will go stark mad.&nbsp; I have also much pleasure
in informing your gracious Majesty that His Grace the Duke of
Devonshire has presented the people of Keighley with a plot of
ground to be called the Devonshire Park, which will be opened on
the occasion of your Majesty&rsquo;s Jubilee; also that Henry
Isaac Butterfield, Esquire, <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>of bonny
Cliffe Castle, has erected a noble-looking structure, to be
called the Jubilee Tower, which will be opened on the day of your
Majesty&rsquo;s Grand Jubilee, to commemorate your
Majesty&rsquo;s glorious reign.&nbsp; This gentleman is a native
of Keighley, and fairly entitled to be knighted by your gracious
Majesty, seeing that he has done more to beautify the town than
all the rest.&nbsp; It has also been given out that the town has
to be honoured by a royal visit from your Majesty&rsquo;s
grandson, Prince George.&nbsp; But pray take a fool&rsquo;s
advice, your Majesty, and don&rsquo;t let him come unless he is
able to pay his own expenses; for I can assure His Royal Highness
that this is the city of number oneism.&nbsp; Yet with the
exception of parting with the bawbees, I dare be sworn that your
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects in Keighley are the grand and genuine
men of the shire, take them in art and science, flood or
field.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that your Most Gracious Majesty will excuse
the blunt and out-spoken Bard, who will ever remain your
Majesty&rsquo;s most humble and obedient servant,&mdash;BILL
O&rsquo;TH&rsquo; HOYLUS END.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I beg your Majesty&rsquo;s most humble pardon, for
since I addressed your most gracious Majesty a note has come to
me stating that the Brewers, Bakers, Shoemakers, and Tailors,
have subscribed and bought a splendid Ox, which will be roasted
and served to the poor on the occasion of the celebration of your
most gracious Majesty&rsquo;s Jubilee.</p>
<p>Then Hail to England&rsquo;s Gracious Queen!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis now proclaimed afar,<br />
The Jubilee of our Gracious Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Empire&rsquo;s Guiding Star.<br />
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>For fifty years she&rsquo;s been to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A Monarch and a Mother;<br />
And looks her subjects in the face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Sister or a Brother.</p>
<p>Then here&rsquo;s a health to England&rsquo;s Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom Jove to us hath given;<br />
A better Monarch ne&rsquo;er has been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath His starry heaven.<br />
There is no man of any clan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er any land or sea,<br />
But what will sing &ldquo;God bless our Queen&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On her grand Jubilee.</p>
<p>The world looks on Old England&rsquo;s Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In danger for protection;<br />
Nor never yet hath England failed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make her grand correction.<br />
&ldquo;Fair play,&rdquo; she cries, no one shall harm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A child beneath my realm;<br />
I&rsquo;m Captain of Great Britain&rsquo;s barque<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And standing at the helm.</p>
<p>Had England trusted wicked men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This day where had she been?<br />
But lo! she had a Guiding Star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas our dear Mother Queen.<br />
There is no foe, where&rsquo;er you go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This day, I vow, could hate her;<br />
She&rsquo;s a blessing to her nation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a terror to a traitor.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>As she has been, long may she reign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Old Queen of Britain;<br />
In letters of bright gold her name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforward should be written.<br />
All nations &rsquo;neath the stars above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And canopy of heaven,<br />
Rejoice to see her Jubilee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Eighteen Eighty-seven.</p>
<h3>Ode to Burns on his 130th Birthday.</h3>
<p>Weak bard, but thou dost try in vain<br />
To tune that mighty harp again,<br />
To try thy muse in Burns&rsquo;s strain&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;rt
far behind.<br />
And yet to praise him thou would&rsquo;st fain&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thy
mind.</p>
<p>He who sang of Bruce&rsquo;s command<br />
At Bannockburn, with sword in hand,<br />
And bid his warriors firmly stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the
spot;<br />
And bid the foemen leave the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or face the
Scot.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>He who freed the human mind<br />
Of superstitious weak and blind;<br />
He who peered the scenes behind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their holy
fairs&mdash;<br />
How orthodox its pockets lined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With canting
prayers.</p>
<p>Yes; he whose life&rsquo;s short span appears<br />
Mixed up with joyous smiles and tears;<br />
So interwove with doubts and fears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His harp did
ring;<br />
And made the world to ope&rsquo; its ears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear him
sing.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas his to walk the lonely glen,<br />
Betimes to shun the haunts of men,<br />
Searching for his magic pen&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poetic fire;<br
/>
And far beyond the human ken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He strung the
lyre.</p>
<p>And well old Scotland may be proud<br />
To hear her Burns proclaimed aloud,<br />
For to her sons the world hath bowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through
Burns&rsquo;s name&mdash;<br />
All races of the world are proud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Burns&rsquo;s
fame.</p>

<p>A Military description of the Second Excursion to Malsis Hall,
the Residence of JAMES LUND, Esq.</p>
<p>I remember perusing when I was a boy,<br />
The immortal bard Homer&mdash;his siege of old Troy,<br />
So the Malsis encampment I&rsquo;ll sing if you will,<br />
How our brave army &ldquo;bivoked&rdquo; on the plains o&rsquo;
Park Hill.</p>
<p>Near the grand Hall o&rsquo; Malsis our quarters we took,<br
/>
When Lieuteuant-col. Don Frederick spoke,<br />
Commanding his aid-de-camp Colonel de Mann,<br />
To summons and muster the chiefs o&rsquo; the clan.</p>
<p>Majors Wood, Lamb, and Pollard came up to the lines,<br />
Each marching their companies up to the nines;<br />
The twirlers and twisters, the knights of the coal,<br />
And spuzzers and sorters fell in at the roll.</p>
<p>The light-infantry captains were Robin and Shack,<br />
And the gallant big &ldquo;benners&rdquo; the victuals did
sack;<br />
Captain Green he commanded the Indigo troop,<br />
These beer barrel chargers none with them can cope.</p>
<p>The Amazon army led on by Queen Bess,<br />
Each feminine soldier so grand was her dress,<br />
Though they chatted and pratted, &rsquo;twor pleasant to see<br
/>
Them laughing and quaffing their hot rum and tea.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>There was music to dainties and music to wine,<br />
And for fear of invaders no hearts did repine;<br />
Although a dark cloud swept over the plain,<br />
Yet our quarter was sheltered from famine and rain.</p>
<p>Drum-Major Ben Rushworth and Bandmaster Wright,<br />
Drank to each other with pleasure that night;<br />
We&rsquo;d full-flowing bumpers, we&rsquo;d music and fun,<br />
From the larder and cellar of Field-Marshall Lund.</p>
<p>One Private Tom Berry got into the hall,<br />
When a big rump o&rsquo; beef he made rather small;<br />
And Flintergill Billy of the Spuzzer&rsquo;s Brigade,<br />
Got his beak in the barrel, and havoc he made.</p>
<p>The Field-Marshall declared, and his good lady too,<br />
They ne&rsquo;er were attacked with so pleasant a foe;<br />
With this all the clansmen gave them three cheers,<br />
In return they saluted the bold Buchaneers.</p>
<h3>The Benks o&rsquo; the Aire.</h3>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t the star of the evening that breetens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; fairy-like leetness the owd Rivock
ends,<br />
Nor is it the bonny green fields up ta Steeton,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the benks of the river while strolling wi&rsquo;
friends,<br />
That tempts me to wander at twilight so lonely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave the gay feast for others to share;<br />
But O there&rsquo;s a charm, and a charm for me only,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sweet little cot on the Benks o&rsquo; the
Aire.</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>How sweet and remote from all turmoil and danger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that cot, wi&rsquo; my Mary, I could pass the
long years:<br />
In friendship and peace lift the latch to a stranger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chase off the anguish o&rsquo; pale
sorrow&rsquo;s tears.<br />
We&rsquo;d walk aght in t&rsquo;morning when t&rsquo;young sun
wor shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When t&rsquo;birds hed awakened, an&rsquo;
t&rsquo;lark soar&rsquo;d i&rsquo; t&rsquo;air,<br />
An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d watch its last beam, on my Mary reclining,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From ahr dear little cot on the Benks o&rsquo; the
Aire.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;d talk o&rsquo; the past, when our loves wor
forbidden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When fortune wor adverse, an&rsquo; friends wod
deny,<br />
How ahr hearts wor still true, tho&rsquo; the favours wor
hidden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fra the charm of ahr life, the mild stare of ahr
eye.<br />
An&rsquo; when age sall hev temper&rsquo;d ahr warm glow o&rsquo;
feelin&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahr loves should endure, an&rsquo; still wod we
share;<br />
For weal or in woe, or whativver cums stealin&rsquo;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;d share in ahr cot on the Benks o&rsquo;
the Aire.</p>
<p>Then hasten, my Mary, the moments are flying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us catch the bright fugitives ere they
depart;<br />
For O, thou knaws not what pleasures supplyin&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy bonny soft image hes nah geen my heart.<br />
The miser that wanders besides buried treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; his eyes ever led to the spot in
despair;<br />
How different to him is my rapture and pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the dear little cot on the Benks o&rsquo; the
Aire.</p>
<p>But sooin may the day come, if come it will ivver;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The breetest an&rsquo; best to me ivver knawn,<br />
When fate may ordain us no longer to sever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, sweet girl of my heart, I can call thee my
own.<br />
For dear unto me wor one moment beside thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it wor in the desert, Mary, wi&rsquo; me;<br />
But sweeter an&rsquo; fairer, whate&rsquo;er betide thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In ahr sweet little cot on the Benks o&rsquo; the
Aire.</p>

<p>He was a man, an upright man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever trod this mortal earth,<br />
And now upon him back we scan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose greatest fault was honest mirth.</p>
<p>But never more his friends will see<br />

Nor hear his jokes with heartfelt glee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made dull care before them fly.</p>
<p>Nor ever more the friend shall find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When labour lacks, the shake of hand<br />
That oft was wont to leave behind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What proved a Brother and a Friend.</p>
<p>In winter&rsquo;s bitter, biting frost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hail, or snow, or rain, or sleet,<br />
The wretch upon life&rsquo;s tempest toss&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In him found shelter from the street.</p>
<p>The unemployed, the aged poor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The orphan child, the lame and blind,<br />
The stranger never crossed his floor<br />

<p>But now the hand and heart are gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which were so noble, kind and true,<br />
And now his friends, e&rsquo;en every one,<br />

class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Dame Europe&rsquo;s
Lodging-House.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">A Burlesque on the Franco-Prussian
war</span>.</p>
<p>Dame Europe kept a Lodging-House,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was fond of brass;<br />
She took in public lodgers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every rank and class.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d French and German, Dutch and Swiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And other nations too;<br />
So poor old Mrs. Europe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had lots of work to do.</p>
<p>I cannot just now name her beds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her number being so large;<br />
But five she kept for deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which she had in her charge.</p>
<p>So in this famous Lodging-House,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; John Bull he stood A1;<br />
On him she always kept an eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see things rightly done.</p>
<p>And Master Louis was her next,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And second, there&rsquo;s no doubt,<br />
For when a little row took place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He always backed John out.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>And in her house was Alex. Russ;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft him they eyed with fear;<br />
For Alex. was a lazy hound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept a Russian Bear.</p>
<p>Her fourth was a man of grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was for heaven bent;<br />
His name was Pious William,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his Testament.</p>
<p>Her fifth, too, was a pious Knave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis our firm belief,<br />
He once did rob the Hungary Lads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hard-earned bread and beef.</p>
<p>These were Dame Europe&rsquo;s deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In whom she put her trust,<br />
To keep her Lodging-House at peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In case eruption burst.</p>
<p>For many a time a row took place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While sharing out the scran;<br />
But John and Louis soon stepp&rsquo;d in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleared the <i>padding can</i>.</p>
<p>Once, Alex. Russ&rsquo;s father, Nick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bit before he died,<br />
Did roughly seize a little Turk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thought to warm his hide.</p>
<p>But John and Louis interfered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring it foul play;<br />
And made old Nick remember it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until his dying day.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Now all Dame Europe&rsquo;s deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They made themselves at home;<br />
And every lodger knew his bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise his sitting room.</p>
<p>They took great interest in their beds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept them very clean;<br />
Unlike some other <i>padding cans</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dirty and so mean.</p>
<p>The best and choicest bed of all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was occupied by Johnny;<br />
Because the Dame did favour him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He did collect her money.</p>
<p>And in a little bunk he lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal&rsquo;d up with oak, and tarr&rsquo;d;<br />
He would not let a single one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come near within a yard.</p>
<p>A Jack-of-all-trades, too, was John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And aught he&rsquo;d do for brass;<br />
And what he ever took in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No one could him surpass.</p>
<p>When tired of being shut in the bunk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes he went across,<br />
To spend an hour with Master Loo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they the wine would toss.</p>
<p>So many a happy day they spent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These lads, with one another;<br />
While every lodger in the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought John was Louis&rsquo; brother.</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>The Dame allowed John something nice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To get well in her rent,<br />
Which every now and then i&rsquo; t&rsquo;bank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it on per cent.</p>
<p>And working very hard himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst his tar and pitch;<br />
He soon accumulated wealth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made him very rich.</p>
<p>Now Louis had a pleasant crib<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was admired by lots,<br />
And being close by a window,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had some flower pots.</p>
<p>The next to Louis&rsquo; bed was Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest Monitor<br />
And though he did pretend a saint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was as big a cur.</p>
<p>He loved to make them all believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was opposed to strife,<br />
And said he never caused a row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No, never in his life.</p>
<p>He was so fond of singing psalms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he read his testament;<br />
That everybody was deceived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was mischief bent.</p>
<p>He seldom passed a lodger&rsquo;s bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But what he took a glance,<br />
Which made them every one suspect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d rob if he&rsquo;d a chance.</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Now Louis had two flower pots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He nourished with much care,<br />
But little knew that Willie&rsquo;s eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were set upon the pair.</p>
<p>In one there grew an <span class="smcap">Alsace
Rose</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other a <span class="smcap">Lorraine</span>,<br
/>
And Willie vowed they once were his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And must be his again.</p>
<p>He said his father once lodged there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the Dame did know<br />
That Louis&rsquo; predecessors once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had sneaked them in a row.</p>
<p>In Willie&rsquo;s council was a lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well up to every quirk;<br />
To keep him out of mischief long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame Europe had her work.</p>
<p>To this smart youth Saint Willie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did whisper his desire,<br />
One night as they sat smoking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the kitchen fire&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get them flowers back again,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Bissy, very low,<br />
&ldquo;Meet Louis somewhere on the quiet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And try to cause a row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mind the other deputies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t catch you on the hop,<br />
For John and Joseph you must know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your little game would stop.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;For Joseph he has not forgot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The day you warmed his rig;<br />
And christian Denmark still thinks on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About his nice Slesvig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your advice, my own Dear Mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been guided on,<br />
But what about that man i&rsquo;t&rsquo;bunk?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pointing o&rsquo;er to John.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very plucky too is John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet he&rsquo;s very slow,<br />
And perhaps he never may perceive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our scheme about the row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not another word of this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To anybody&rsquo;s ears,<br />
The Dame she plays the list&rsquo;ner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my doubts and fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let us go upstairs at once,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it will be best,<br />
And let us pray to Him above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we go to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with a pious countenance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His prayers as usual said,<br />
But squinting round the room the while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spied an empty bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity that these empty stocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be unoccupied;<br />
Do you think my little cousin, Mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To them could be denied?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis just the very thing,&rdquo; said
Mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your cousin, sir, and you,<br />
Would carry out my scheme first-rate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One at each side of Loo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dame being asked, did not object,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If he could pay the rent,<br />
And had a decent character,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Louis would consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do object to this,&rdquo; says Loo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And on this very ground,<br />
Willie and his cousins, ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They soon would me surround.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nothing in my line at all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are so near a-kin,<br />
And so if I consent to this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At once they&rsquo;ll hem me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you couldn&rsquo;t think it, Master Loo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should do you harm,<br />
For don&rsquo;t I read my testament<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t I sing my psalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all my eye,&rdquo; said Louis,
&ldquo;both<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your testament and psalms;<br />
You use the dumbbells regular<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To strengthen up your arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So take your poor relation off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You pious-looking prig,<br />
And open out Kit Denmark&rsquo;s box,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give him back Slesvig.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; says Mrs. Europe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have no bother here,<br />
You&rsquo;re trying now to breed a row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least it does appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Johnny hearing from the bunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What both of them did say,<br />
He shouted out, &ldquo;Now stop it, Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else you&rsquo;ll rue the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, friend John, I&rsquo;m much obliged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are my friend, I know,<br />
And so my little cousin, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to withdraw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Louis frothed at mouth with rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one that was insane,<br />
And said he&rsquo;d make Bill promise him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d not offend again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d promise no such thing,&rdquo; says Mark,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For that would hurt your pride,<br />
Sing on and read your testament,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame Europe&rsquo;s on your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d to promise aught like that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be against my mind;<br />
So take it right or take it wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll promise naught o&rsquo;
t&rsquo;kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall take and wallop thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless thou cuts thy stick;<br />
And drive thee to thy fatherland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before another week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; cried Sanctimonius,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sending out his arm<br />
He caught poor Louis on the nose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sung another psalm.</p>
<p>But Louis soon was on his pins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And used his fists a bit,<br />
But he was fairly out of breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seldom ever hit.</p>
<p>And at the end of round the first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He got it fearful hot,<br />
This was his baptism of fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we mistake it not.</p>
<p>So Willie sent a letter home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mother old Augusta,<br />
Telling her he&rsquo;d thrashed poor Loo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And given him such a duster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wonderful events,&rdquo; says he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Has heaven brought about,<br />
I&rsquo;ll fight the greatest pugilist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever was brought out.</p>
<p>And if by divine Providence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I get safe through this row,<br />
Then I will sing &lsquo;My God, the spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom all blessings flow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other Monitors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were standing looking on,<br />
But none of them dare speak a word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all stared straight at John.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;Ought not I to interfere?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says Johnny to the rest;<br />
But he was told by every one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutrality was best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neutral,&rdquo; growl&rsquo;d John, &ldquo;I hate the
word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis poison to my ear;<br />
It&rsquo;s another word for cowardice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes me fit to swear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate I can do this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind I will not mask,<br />
I&rsquo;ll give poor Loo a little drop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of my brandy flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give it up, poor Loo, my lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You might as well give in,<br />
You know that I have got no power;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, you did begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Louis rose, and looked at John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spoke of days gone by<br />
When he would not have seen his friend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have blackened Johnny&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for giving in, friend John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort;<br />
Do you think I&rsquo;ll be a laughing-stock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For everybody&rsquo;s sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation that took place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made pious Willie grin,<br />
And tell John Bull to hold his noise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nought to do with him.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>These words to John did make him stare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And finding to his shame,<br />
That those were worse who did look on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than those who played the game.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Europe knew the facts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which had been going on,<br />
And with her usual dignity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These words addressed to John:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Bull, pray answer me,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you gaping here?<br />
You are my famous deputy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why not interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered John, and made a bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet was very shy,<br />
&ldquo;I was told to be a neutral, ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what you should not have done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Being in authority;<br />
Did I not place you in that bunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To think and act for me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why any baby in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not have done much worse,<br />
But I fancy you&rsquo;ve been holding back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To save your private purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neutrality is as fine a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever a coward used,<br />
The honour that I gave to you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t have abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>The minor lodgers in the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing this, to John,<br />
Began to whisper and to laugh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And call&rsquo;d it famous fun.</p>
<p>At last a little urchin said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Please ma&rsquo;am I&rsquo;d take my oath,<br
/>
&rsquo;At master John was neutral,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stuck up for them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck up for both, offended both,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes that is what you mean?&rdquo;<br />
Continued Madame Europe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then spoke to John again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve long watch&rsquo;d your career,<br />
You take your fags&rsquo; advice to save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your paltry sums a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bob and Bill, besides some more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I call naught but scums,<br />
They&rsquo;ve got you fairly in between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fingers and their thumbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If such like men as Ben and Hugh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This day your fags had been,<br />
They would have saved both you and me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This curs&rsquo;d disgraceful scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of bein&rsquo; half-clad and shod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As everybody knows,<br />
You would have dared these rivals now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come to such like blows.</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;There was a time in this house, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you put up your thumb,<br />
The greatest blackguard tongue would stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if they had been dumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not a one in this here house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This moment cares a fig<br />
For all you say or all you do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although your purse be big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hurt poor Louis, ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he did begin;<br />
And then you see that Will and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are very near akin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beside, you see,&rdquo; said John again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I let poor Louis sup;<br />
On both I use my ointment, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wounds I did bind up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! weel a day,&rdquo; then said the Dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But was affected sore,<br />
&ldquo;I see you have some small excuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you have done it for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some little hopes left yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you may yet have sense,<br />
To know your high position, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of saving pence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You yet will learn that duty, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot be ignored,<br />
However disagreeable when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed before the board.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;And let me tell you he who shirks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The responsibility<br />
Of seeing right, is doing wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And earns humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis an empty-headed dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To boast of skill and power,<br />
But dare not even interfere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At this important hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better far confess at once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not fit for your place,<br />
Than have a name &lsquo;Heroic,&rsquo; sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Branded with disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not say another word;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My deputies, to you;<br />
But hope you will a warning take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This moment from poor Loo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hoping, John, your enemies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May never have the chance<br />
To see you paid for watching Will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrash poor weak Louis France.&rdquo;</p>

Riddlesden Hall.</h3>
<p>On Aire&rsquo;s bonny benks wi&rsquo; her meadows so green,<br
/>
There&rsquo;s an ancient owd hall to-day may be seen,<br />
That wor built in the days of some owd feudal king,<br />
Of whom the owd bards delighted to sing.<br />
Tho&rsquo; its splendour&rsquo;s now faded, its greatness was
then<br />
Known to its foemen as Red Lion&rsquo;s den;<br />
&rsquo;Neath its armorial shield, an&rsquo; hoary owd wall,<br />
I now see Rebecca o&rsquo; Riddlesden Hall.</p>
<p>Her majestic black eyes true beauty display,<br />
Resemblin&rsquo; truly the goddess of day;<br />
Her dark-flowin&rsquo; ringlets, you&rsquo;d think as they
shone,<br />
&rsquo;At Venus hed fashion&rsquo;d &rsquo;em after her awn.<br
/>
For her tresses no ribbons nor trappins do bind,<br />
But wantonly luxurious flow in the wind:<br />
&rsquo;Twod o&rsquo; pleased the great Reubens or Turner to
call,<br />
To see sweet Rebecca o&rsquo; Riddlesden Hall.</p>
<p>Like the tall mountain fir, she&rsquo;s as steady, I trow,<br
/>
When zephyr-like winds do sighingly blow;<br />
The grove or the grotto when mild breezes move,<br />
Are gentle Rebecca&rsquo;s sweet gales of love.<br />
Her breath, where true wit so gracefully flows,<br />
Has the beautiful scent of the pink an&rsquo; the rose;<br />
There&rsquo;s no nymph from the East to Niagara&rsquo;s Fall,<br
/>
To equal Rebecca o&rsquo; Riddlesden Hall.</p>

O then is Rebecca so pleasin&rsquo; to view.<br />
Wi&rsquo; her gray Wolsey stockings by hersel knit an&rsquo;
spun,<br />
An&rsquo; a nice little apron, hieroglyphic&rsquo;ly done:<br />
It needs no rich velvets or Cashmere shawl,<br />
To deck out Rebecca o&rsquo; Riddlesden Hall.</p>
<p>Love, grace, an&rsquo; beauty attend at her will;<br />
She wounds wi&rsquo; a look, wi&rsquo; a frown she can kill;<br

The youths as they pass her, exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;Woe is

Who sees her must love her, who loves her must dee.<br />
At Church on a Sabbath, owd men raise ther arms,<br />
An&rsquo; cry, &ldquo;O, great heavens! wor ivver sich

While matrons an&rsquo; maidens God&rsquo;s blessin&rsquo; they

On the head of Rebecca o&rsquo; Riddlesden Hall.</p>

<h3>The City of &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br />
(<span class="smcap">a dream</span>).</h3>
<p>[It is said that when Giles Clumps, the South-downer, first
came to Keighley, the first question he asked his fellow labourer
was this, &ldquo;What religion be th&rsquo; master
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A Liberal,&rdquo; was the answer;
&ldquo;So be I,&rdquo; says Giles.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what politics
be th&rsquo; master?&rdquo; asked Giles again, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a Methody,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;So be I,&rdquo; says
Giles again, &ldquo;I be a Methody too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now do not
imagine for a moment that Giles Clumps is the <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>only
&ldquo;So be I&rdquo; in Keighley, for the whole town is full of
&ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and it is a well-known fact that
if six long <span class="smcap">yellow</span> chimneys were to
turn <span class="smcap">blue</span> to-morrow, there
wouldn&rsquo;t be a Liberal in six hours in the city of &ldquo;So
be I&rsquo;s,&rdquo; with the exception of the old veteran <span
class="smcap">Squire Leach</span>.]</p>
<p>Oh list to my dream, nor yet think it wrong,<br />
If I tell it in rhyme, or sing it in song;<br />
For when I look back on the sights that were there,<br />
I could almost, like Blondin, dance high in the air.</p>
<p>For when I reflect, my heart leaps with joy&mdash;<br />
What I saw in my dream in old &ldquo;So be I,&rdquo;<br />
For thousands were shouting on that pleasant day.<br />
We are all &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s,&rdquo; hip, hip, hip
hurrah!</p>
<p>And I took the first chance to ask what it meant,<br />
Of the people who shouted, what was their intent,<br />
When an elderly lady soon gave me the cue,<br />
Of what was the matter and what was to do.</p>
<p>Six great millocrats, call them Whigs if you will,<br />
The gods of our labour in workshop and mill:<br />
Have all turned their colours from Yellow to Blue,<br />
Which has caused this commotion the city all through.</p>
<p>Led on by the nose, like a bull in a band,<br />
See how all the &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s&rdquo; follow so grand,<br
/>
The fag and the artist, the plebian also,<br />
Have now chang&rsquo;d their colour from yellow to blue.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>There&rsquo;s twenty-eight thousand true &ldquo;So be
I&rsquo;s&rdquo; here,<br />
And there&rsquo;s not a Liberal amongst them I&rsquo;ll swear,<br
/>
For the millocrats chieftains proclaimed it they say,<br />
That all must turn Tories on this very day.</p>
<p>So upon the procession, I did my eyes fix,<br />
Reviewing and skewing this wonderful six;<br />
They wore blue ribands so grand in their coats,<br />
Singing &ldquo;So be I&rdquo; joskins come give us your
votes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s&rdquo; exerted each nerve and
limb,<br />
To follow their leaders and join in the swim;<br />
And I plainly could see, so I thought in my dream,<br />
That the way through the world is to follow the stream.</p>
<p>For the faces of parsons were lit up so bright,<br />
And the doctors they smiled with the greatest delight;<br />
And a lawyer he vowed that he&rsquo;d have a Blue gown,<br />
For he&rsquo;d been long enough a black Liberal clown.</p>
<p>Methought the Ranters, and Methodies too,<br />
Independents and Quakers, and Baptists, were blue;<br />
And as I looked round me, lo! what did I see,<br />
A batch of Teetotallers had got on the spree.</p>
<p>But what I considered the best of the sport,<br />
Took place in front of the old County Court;<br />
The Mayor and Ex-Mayor were dancing a jig,<br />
With the County Court Judge in his gown and his wig.</p>
<p>Methought that the Draper and Hatter filed in,<br />
Along with the Grocer, his nearest of kin;<br />
And I caught the Co-oper just in the neck,<br />
In his hand were his divi. and new silver check.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Methought as I walked I sprang up so high,<br />
That I really found out I was able to fly;<br />
So backwards and forwards methought that I flew,<br />
To the clubs of the town which I found were all Blue.</p>
<p>Till somehow or other, I got quite astray,<br />
And over Cliffe Castle I wing&eacute;d my way,<br />
Thinks I, there&rsquo;s some Foreign &ldquo;So be I&rdquo;
geese<br />
Have crossed o&rsquo;er the Channel from Paris or Nice.</p>
<p>From thence I took wing, as blithe as a lark,<br />
And crossed o&rsquo;er the town to Jim Collingham&rsquo;s
Park;<br />
But ere I arrived at the end of my route,<br />
A lightning conductor caught the tail of my coat.</p>
<p>I hung there suspended high up in the air,<br />
Looking down on the mob in the wildest despair,<br />
Imploring the &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s&rdquo; to get me relief;<br
/>
But they shouted &ldquo;Stop there, you Liberal thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I called on the de&rsquo;il and invoked the skies,<br />
To curse and set fire to all &ldquo;So be I&rsquo;s;&rdquo;<br />
When all of a sudden I scratched at my head,<br />
Awoke from my dream&mdash;found myself snug in bed.</p>

<p>Most respectfully dedicated to the Rev. F. D. CREMER, St.
ANDREW&rsquo;S, Keighley, Oct. 25th, 1889.</p>
<p>Dear reverend sir, excuse your humble servant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose heart you&rsquo;ve made this very night to
glow;<br />
I thank you kindly, and my prayers most fervent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will ever be, dear reverend sir, for you.</p>
<p>My ideas lacked for want of information,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glad am I to glean a little more,<br />
About the Churches of our mighty nation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose chimes are heard on many a far-off shore.</p>
<p>My heart was moved, for I was much astounded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view the many Churches of our land;<br />
The life-like pictures of the saints who founded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These ruins old, so wonderful and grand.</p>
<p>For oft I&rsquo;ve wished, and often have I pondered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And longed to learn the history of our kirk;<br />
How it was handed down to us I&rsquo;ve wondered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who were they that did this mighty work.</p>
<p>The veil&rsquo;s removed, and now my sight is clearer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the sacred history of our isle;<br />
For while I view these scenes it brings me nearer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the Church on which the angels smile.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; For one short hour to bring before his sight,<br />
The pictures of the great and mighty treasures&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our English Church, which brought the world to
light.</p>
<p>Great Men dive deep down into wisdom&rsquo;s river&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet, philosopher, and sage&mdash;<br />
For wisdom&rsquo;s pearls, which showeth forth for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor waste their sweetness or grow dull with age.</p>
<p>Who would not walk through ruins old and hoary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make each relic and persue his search?<br />
Who would not listen and applaud each story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Told of an ancient good and English Church?</p>
<p>Each view so grand, mixed up with sacred singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that old Church&mdash;I humbly call it mine,<br
/>
For still my heart to it is ever clinging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And He who died for me in ancient Palestine.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 140</span>The Old Hand-Wool-Combers:</h3>
<p>Lines written on the occasion of a Banquet given by His
Worship the Mayor (Ald. ICKRINGILL), March 28th, 1891.</p>
<p>Come hither my muse and give me a start,<br />
And let me give praise to the one famous art;<br />
For it&rsquo;s not an M.P. or a Mayor that I toast,<br />
But the ancient Wool-comber, the Knight of the post.</p>
<p>In the brave days of old when I was a boy,<br />
I went to the Comb Shop, my heart full of joy;<br />
Where I listened to stories and legends of old,<br />
Which to me were more precious than silver or gold.</p>
<p>The old Comber would tell of his travels through life,<br />
And where he had met with his darling old wife;<br />
And how he had stole her from her native vale,<br />
To help him to pull the &ldquo;old tup&rdquo; by the
&ldquo;tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would go through the tales of his youthful career,<br />
An undaunted youth without dread or fear;<br />
He knew all the natives, the rich and the poor,<br />
He knew every acre of mountain and moor.</p>
<p>He could make a sad tale of the wrongs of the State,<br />
And tell where old England would be soon or late;<br />
How nations would rise, and monarch&rsquo;s would fall,<br />
And tyrants would tremble and go to the wall.</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>He was very well read, though papers were dear,<br />
But he got <i>Reynold&rsquo;s</i> newspaper year after year;<br
/>
It was bound to his bosom and he read it so keen,<br />
While at times he fair hated a King or a Queen.</p>
<p>He was fairly dramatic, the stage he loved well,<br />
The names of great actors and plays he would tell;<br />
And if that his notion it took the other way,<br />
He could quote the Bible a night and a day.</p>
<p>Full of wit, full of mirth, he could give you a sting,<br />
He could preach, he could pray, he could dance, he could sing;<br
/>
He could play pitch and toss, he could jump, he could run,<br />
He could shuffle the cards, he could handle a gun.</p>
<p>The old Constable knew him but let him alone,<br />
Because he knew better than bother with &ldquo;Joan&rdquo;;<br />
For the lads of the Barracks and the Pinfold as well<br />
Would all have been there at the sound of the bell.</p>
<p>Old Keighley was then but a very small town,<br />
Yet she&rsquo;d twelve hundred Combers that were very well
known;<br />
Hundreds have gone over the dark flowing burn,<br />
Whence no traveller was ever yet known to return.</p>
<p>It reminds me again of the Donkey and pack<br />
Which came from the hills bringing Wool on its back;<br />
And if the poor beast perchance had to bray<br />
&rsquo;Twere a true sign a Comber would die on that day.</p>
<p>The third day of the week, sometimes further on,<br />
The old woman would seek the King&rsquo;s Arms for her son;<br />
And if she were told he had not been at all,<br />
Would bounce over the green to the Hole-in-the-Wall.</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Hi! those were fine times, especially the fairs,<br />
When the Inns were kept open for dancing upstairs;<br />
The Commercial, Lord Rodney, as well as the Crown<br />
To the ancient Wool-comber were fairly well known.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;ll get back to the pot and the pad,<br />
The fair it is over, the women are glad;<br />
For now the Wool-comber his follies he sees,<br />
And makes resolutions as staunch as you please.</p>
<p>For now he commences to work hard and late,<br />
He is building a Castle on a phantom estate;<br />
And he toils for a time but long hoggs make him sick,<br />
Then he duffs, and his castle falls down, every brick.</p>
<p>When Winter comes in with its keen bitter blast,<br />
And the poor rustic hind has to cope with the frost;<br />
Yet the Comber was happy in village and town,<br />
Though he knew that his calling was fast going down.</p>
<p>Oh yes, it was vanquished, the once noble art,<br />
For science had bid it for ever depart;<br />
Yet for thee old Comber fresh fields have arose,<br />
That have found thee in victuals, in fuel, and clothes.</p>
<p>So many brave thanks to the Mayor of the town<br />
Who has made the Wool-comber once more to be known;<br />
Let us drink to the health of our worthy host,<br />
The friend of the Comber, the Knight of the post.</p>

<p>In a little cot so dreary,<br />
With eyes and forehead hot and bleary,<br />
Sat a mother sad and weary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her darling on her knee;<br
/>
Their humble fare at best was sparing<br />
For the father he was shearing,<br />
With his three brave sons of Erin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All down in the Fen countree.</p>
<p>All her Saxon neighbours leave her,<br />
With her boy and demon fever,<br />
The midnight watch&mdash;none to relieve her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save a little Busy Bee:<br />
He was called the Harem-Skarem,<br />
Noisy as a drum-clock larum,<br />
Yet his treasures he would share &rsquo;em,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his friend right merrily.</p>
<p>Every night and every morning,<br />
With the day sometimes at dawning&mdash;<br />
While lay mother, sick and swooning&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To his dying mate went he:<br />
Robbing his good Saxon mother,<br />
Giving to his Celtic brother,<br />
Who asked for him and no other,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until his spirit it was free.</p>
<p>Saw the shroud and saw the coffin;<br />
Brought the pipes and brought the snuff in;<br />
This little noble-hearted ruffian,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the wake each night went he:<br
/>
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Sabbath morning he was ready,<br />
Warn&rsquo;d the bearers to be steady,<br />
Taking Peter to his beddy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a tear stood in his
e&rsquo;e.</p>
<p>Onward as the corpse was passing,<br />
Ere the priest gave his last blessing,<br />
Through the dingy crowd came pressing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father and the brothers
three;<br />
&rsquo;Tis our mother&mdash;we will greet her;<br />
How is this that here we meet her?<br />
And without our little Peter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will solve this mystery?</p>
<p>The Harem-Skarem interfered,<br />
&ldquo;Soon this corpse will be interred,<br />
Come with us and see it buried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out in yonder
cemet&rsquo;ry:&rdquo;<br />
Soon they knew the worst and pondered<br />
Half-amazed and half-dumbfounded;&mdash;<br />
And returning home, they wondered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who their little friend could
be!</p>
<p>Turning round to him they bowed,<br />
Much they thanked him, much they owed;<br />
While the tears each cheek bedewed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish&rsquo;d him all
prosperity:<br />
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my brothers,<br />
What I&rsquo;ve done, do ye to others;<br />
We&rsquo;re all poor barns o&rsquo; some poor mothers,&rdquo;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said the little Busy Bee.</p>

Thy dowters are handsome, thy sons they are rare;<br />
When I walk thro&rsquo; thy dells, by the clear running
streams,<br />
I think o&rsquo; my boyhood an&rsquo; innocent dreams.</p>
<p>No care o&rsquo; this life then troubled my breast,<br />
I wor like a young bird new fligged fra its nest;<br />
Wi&rsquo; my dear little mates did I frolic and play,<br />
Wal life&rsquo;s sweetest moments wor flying away.</p>
<p>As the dew kissed the daisies their portals to close,<br />
At neet i&rsquo; my bed I did sweetly repose;<br />
An&rsquo; rose in the morning at Nature&rsquo;s command,<br />
Till fra boyhood to manhood my frame did expand.</p>
<p>The faces that once were familiar to me,<br />
Those that did laugh at my innocent glee;<br />
I fancy I see them, tho&rsquo; now far away,<br />
Or p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps i&rsquo; Bingley church-yard they may
lay.</p>
<p>For since I&rsquo;ve embarked on life&rsquo;s stormy seas,<br
/>
My mind&rsquo;s like the billows that&rsquo;s nivver at ease;<br
/>
Yet I still hev a hope my last moments to crown&mdash;<br />
In thee, dearest village, to lay myself down.</p>

Hill.</h3>
<p>[This extraordinary &ldquo;hero&rdquo; either bore false
witness against his neighbour, a poor artisan, or (taking his own
word for it) saved the nation from great disaster and ruin by
putting out a fire that no one saw but himself.]</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard of great fires in city and town,<br />
And many disasters by fire are known;<br />
But surely this fire which I&rsquo;m going to tell,<br />
Was worse than Mount Etna, Vesuvius, or hell;<br />
For the great prophecy it no doubt would fulfil,<br />
But for <i>t&rsquo;heroic</i> watchman at Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p>This fire broke out in the night it was said,<br />
While peaceful each villager slept in his bed;<br />
And so greatly the flames did light up the skies,<br />
That it took the big watchman all in surprise,<br />
Yet great was the courage and undaunted the skill<br />
Of the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p>He swore by his Maker, the flames rose so high,<br />
That within a few yards, they reached to the sky;<br />
And so greatly they lighted up mountains and dales,<br />
He could see into Ireland, Scotland and Wales!<br />
And so easily the beaks did swallow his pill,<br />
They fined the poor artist of Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Now, there&rsquo;s some foolish people are led to
suppose,<br />
It was by some shavings this fire first arose;<br />
But yet says our hero, &ldquo;I greatly suspect,<br />
This fire was caused by the grossest neglect;<br />
But I&rsquo;m glad its put out, let it be as it will,&rdquo;<br
/>
Says the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p>He needed no witness to swear what he&rsquo;d done,<br />
Yet if he had wanted he could have had one;<br />
For one Tommy Twister, that never was there,<br />
Saw the sparks from the chimney, as they flew in the air,<br />
The greatest sized coal-pot no doubt they would fill,<br />
Like the head of the <i>hero</i> of Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p>So many brave thanks to this <i>heroic</i> knave,<br />
For thousands of lives no doubt he did save,<br />
And but for this hero, disaster had spread,<br />
And smothered the nation while sleeping in bed;<br />
But to save all his people it was the Lord&rsquo;s will,<br />
Through the <i>heroic</i> watchman at Calversyke Hill.</p>
<p>So mind and be careful and put out your lights,<br />
All ye with red noses in case they ignite,<br />
Or perhaps from your bed you may have to leap,<br />
In case this great watchman chances to sleep,<br />
For as rumours are spread, he is fond of his gill,<br />
Is the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversyke Hill.</p>

<p>Lines written on the Keighley Cricket Club Bazaar of 1889, and

<p>I sing not of grim-visaged war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor diplomatic rage,<br />
But I shall string my harp in praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the worthies of our age.</p>
<p>They are a class of noble men,<br />

Whose feats so grand adorn our land,<br />

The Roman gladiator fought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To please the Royal Court.</p>
<p>The Spaniard with his javelin knife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild bull&rsquo;s flesh he tears;<br />
But alack a-day! what sports are they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With our grand cricketeers.</p>
<p>And well old Keighley can be proud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her famed sons to-day;<br />
Some of them are with us yet,<br />

<p>Brave Brown! brave Foulds and Waring,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Their well-loved cricket ground.</p>
<p>For well I wot both young and old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will find from year to year,<br />
More interest in the noble sport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the grand old cricketeer.</p>
<p>The Mexican may throw his lance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scotchman put his stone,<br />
With all the scientific skill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of muscle and of bone.</p>
<p>Give Switzerland her honour&rsquo;d place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rifles and with spears,<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
